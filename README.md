jstimer
=======

A simple HTML/JS timer web app for use in meetings and conferences.

My employer puts on an annual science symposium with a large number of attendees. We needed an easy-to-use session countdown timer with a simple display that speakers could understand that also worked off-line so it wasn't dependant on poor conference hotel wifi.
